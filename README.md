# Sonar Signal Classification 🚀

This project builds a **machine learning model** to classify sonar signals as either **"Rock"** or **"Mine"** using **Logistic Regression**. 🧠✨

***

## 📝 Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze sonar data and accurately predict whether an object is a rock or a mine based on the sonar signal features. The workflow includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions on new data. 

***

## 🔧 Features

- Data loading and exploration 📊
- Data preprocessing & splitting 🗂️
- Logistic regression model training 🏋️‍♂️
- Model evaluation with accuracy scores 🎯
- Predictive system for new sonar inputs 🔮

***

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3 🐍
- NumPy 🌟
- Pandas 📝
- scikit-learn 🧪

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x  
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

You can install required libraries with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

### How to Run

1. Download the `.ipynb` notebook from this repository.
2. Upload it to Google Colab or run locally in your preferred Python environment.
3. Follow the notebook to train and evaluate the model.
4. Use the prediction section to test with new sonar data.

## 🔮 Making Predictions

Input your sonar features in the prediction section, and the model will classify the object as either **"Rock"** or **"Mine"**.
